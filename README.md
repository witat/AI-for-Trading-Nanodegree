# AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree
Coding project for the AI for Trading Nanodegree from Udacity course.

## Project

### Project_1 Trading with Momentum
>[P1 Trading with Momentum](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_1%20Trading%20with%20Momentum)

In this project, you will learn to implement a trading strategy on your own, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. You will be supplied with a universe of stocks and time range. You will also be provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

### Project_2 Breakout Strategy Project
>[P2 Breakout Strategy Project](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_2%20Breakout%20Strategy)

In this project, you will implement the breakout strategy. You'll find and remove any outliers. You'll test to see if it has the potential to be profitable using a Histogram and P-Value. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.
