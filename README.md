# AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree
Coding project for the AI for Trading Nanodegree from Udacity course.

## Project

### Project_1 Trading with Momentum
>[P1 Trading with Momentum](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_1%20Trading%20with%20Momentum)

In this project, I learn to implement a trading strategy on your own, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. You will be supplied with a universe of stocks and time range. You will also be provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

### Project_2 Breakout Strategy 
>[P2 Breakout Strategy Project](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_2%20Breakout%20Strategy)

In this project, I implement the breakout strategy. You'll find and remove any outliers. You'll test to see if it has the potential to be profitable using a Histogram and P-Value. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

### Project_3 Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization 
>[P2 Smart Beta and Portfolio Optimization](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_3%20Smart%20Beta%20and%20Portfolio%20Optimization)

In this project, I build a smart beta portfolio and compare it to a benchmark index. To find out how well the smart beta portfolio did, you’ll calculate the tracking error against the index. You’ll then build a portfolio by using quadratic programming to optimize the weights. Your code will rebalance this portfolio and calculate turn over to evaluate the performance. You’ll use this metric to find the optimal rebalancing Frequency. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

### Project_4 Multifactor Model 
>[P4 Multifactor Model](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_4%20Multifactor%20Model)

In this project, I build a statistical risk model using PCA. You’ll use this model to build a portfolio along with 5 alpha factors. You’ll create these factors, then evaluate them using factor-weighted returns, quantile analysis, sharpe ratio, and turnover analysis. At the end of the project, you’ll optimize the portfolio using the risk model and factors using multiple optimization formulations. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

### Project_5 NLP on Financial Statements 
>[P5 NLP on Financial Statements](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_5%20NLP%20on%20Financial%20Statements)

In this project, I do NLP Analysis on 10-k financial statements to generate an alpha factor. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and Loughran-McDonald sentiment word lists.

### Project_6 Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks 
>[P6 Sentiment Analysis with Neural Networks](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_6%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20with%20Neural%20Networks)

In this project, I build your own deep learning model to classify the sentiment of messages from StockTwits, a social network for investors and traders. Your model will be able to predict if any particular message is positive or negative. From this, you'll be able to generate a signal of the public sentiment for various ticker symbols.

### Project_7 Combine Signals for Enhanced Alpha
>[P7 Combine Signals for Enhanced Alpha](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_7%20Combine%20Signals%20for%20Enhanced%20Alpha)

In this project, I combine signals on a random forest for enhanced alpha. While implementing this, you'll have to solve the problem of overlapping samples. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia and sector data from Sharadar.

### Project_8 Backtesting 
>[P8 BBacktesting](https://github.com/witat/AI-for-Trading-Nanodegree/tree/master/Project_8%20Backtesting)
